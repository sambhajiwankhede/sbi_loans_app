Problem before git hub

-How to track the changes in code or file.



When you install git on own pc then open git bash.
git bash is cli software which is used to communicate with git hub repository.
open git bash and configure your name and email.

sambh@Sambhaji MINGW64 /d/Git Practice
$ git config --global user.name "sambhaji"

sambh@Sambhaji MINGW64 /d/Git Practice
$ git config --global user.email "sambhajiwankhede11@gmail.com"

configuring name and email is just one time process in git bash.

Git Architecture:
-------------------
1)Working Tree: project folder/
2)Staging Area: represent which file is eligible for commit
3)Local Repo: in our system git hub maintain one repository
4)Central Repo(Remote)

             -----------------------------------------------------------------------            www.github.com
              git init                    git status                                            ----------------
Developer -> Working Tree -> git add -> Stagging Area -> git commit -> Local Repo -> git push -> Central Repo
             -----------------------------------------------------------------------            -----------------
                             our system(PC)
